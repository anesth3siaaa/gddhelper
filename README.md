A handy, simple and powerful tool for game developers who need but can't bother to plan their videogames.
## What is gddHELPER?
gddHELPER is a web-based tool for game developers that want to work on planning their videogame without going to the trouble of writing it from scratch.

### Features
- Easy to use UI that everyone can quickly pick up
- Great flexibility with a default template, a customization feature and even a "from scratch" option
- Sharing your template is made easy through the "export template" feature that can be loaded inside it
- Web-based, so you can access it whenever and wherever
- Open source, so you can download the website and use it offline/make your own gddH/integrate gddH in your projects

### Exporting options
gddH allows for many exporting options, such as:
-  .md (Markdown)
- .txt (Basic text file)
- .rtf (Rich Text Format)
- .html (Hypertext Markup Language) with integrated CSS for complete customization
## Why not use a template instead?
Templates are a great god-sent gift, but sometimes finding the right template can become really frustating and sometimes appealing your taste buds without interfering yourself can become completely impossible, and we all know that modifying an already existing template is a complete annoyance and pain. gddH lets you customize everything without any of those annoyances.

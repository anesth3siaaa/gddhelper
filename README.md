# gddHELPER
A handy, simple and powerful tool for game developers who need but can't bother to plan their videogames.
## What is gddHELPER?
gddHELPER is a web-based tool for game developers that want to work on planning their videogame without going to the trouble of writing it from scratch. It's perfect for kickstarting your project, giving you complete flexibility without going through the tedious process of customizing pre-made templates that might not even fit your idea.
### Features
- Easy to use UI that everyone can quickly pick up
- Great flexibility with a default template, a customization feature and even a "from scratch" option
- Sharing your template is made easy through the "export template" feature that can be loaded inside it
- Web-based, so you can access it whenever and wherever
- Open source, so you can download the website and use it offline/make your own gddH/integrate gddH in your projects
### Exporting options
gddH allows for many exporting options, such as:
-  .md (Markdown)
- .txt (Basic text file)
- .rtf (Rich Text Format)
- .html (Hypertext Markup Language) with integrated CSS for complete customization
## Why not use a template instead?
Templates are a great god-sent gift, but sometimes finding the right template can become really frustating and sometimes appealing your taste buds without interfering yourself can become completely impossible, and we all know that modifying an already existing template is a complete annoyance and pain. gddH lets you customize everything without any of those annoyances.
## Why gddHELPER?
This idea was born in a very simple way:
At the time of writing this, I am trying to build a videogame but I have no idea how to put down my thoughts in a Game Design Document. I searched for a while, and I found out that there is no website to help you create an actual GDD with your idea in mind, only pre-made templates that don't reflect what I wanted out of my game. So I made it my responsibility to create a website to **HELP** people make **gdd**s (see what I did there?)
